Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error

Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. It's particularly effective for:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles

AI Applications
Modern AI applications include:
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial trading
- Fraud detection

The future of AI holds tremendous potential for solving complex problems and improving human life.
