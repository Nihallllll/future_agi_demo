Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

RAG is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases before generating responses.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Ingestion: Load and process documents
2. Chunking: Split documents into manageable pieces
3. Embedding: Convert text into vector representations
4. Storage: Store embeddings in a vector database
5. Retrieval: Find relevant chunks for a query
6. Generation: Use LLM to generate answer with context

Components of a RAG System:

Vector Database
A specialized database that stores and retrieves vector embeddings efficiently. Popular options include:
- ChromaDB
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Qdrant
- FAISS

Embedding Models
Models that convert text into numerical vectors:
- OpenAI Embeddings
- Google Gemini Embeddings
- Sentence Transformers
- Cohere Embeddings

Language Models
LLMs used for generation:
- GPT-4
- Claude
- Google Gemini
- Llama
- Mistral

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides source attribution
- Enables up-to-date information
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning

Best Practices:
1. Use appropriate chunk sizes (300-800 tokens)
2. Include chunk overlap (10-20%)
3. Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
4. Add metadata for filtering
5. Monitor and evaluate quality
6. Implement caching for efficiency

RAG is particularly useful for:
- Question answering systems
- Customer support chatbots
- Document analysis
- Knowledge management
- Research assistants

The combination of retrieval and generation makes RAG a powerful technique for building reliable AI applications.
